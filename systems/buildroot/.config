#

#
# ----------------------------------------------------
#

#
# Your old configuration uses legacy options that no  
#

#
# longer exist in buildroot, as indicated in the menu 
#

#
# below. As long as these options stay selected, or in
#

#
# case of string options are non-empty, the build     
#

#
# will fail.                                          
#

#
# *                                                   
#

#
# Where possible, an automatic conversion from old to 
#

#
# new symbols has been performed. Before making any   
#

#
# change in this legacy menu, make sure to exit the   
#

#
# configuration editor a first time and save the      
#

#
# configuration. Otherwise, the automatic conversion  
#

#
# of symbols will be lost.                            
#

#
# *                                                   
#

#
# After this initial save, reopen the configuration   
#

#
# editor, inspect the options selected below, read    
#

#
# their help texts, and verify/update the new         
#

#
# configuration in the corresponding configuration    
#

#
# menus. When everything is ok, you can disable the   
#

#
# legacy options in the menu below. Once you have     
#

#
# disabled all legacy options, this text will         
#

#
# disappear and you will be able to start the build.  
#

#
# *                                                   
#

#
# Note: at some point in the future, the oldest legacy
#

#
# options will be removed, and configuration files    
#

#
# that still have those options set, will fail to     
#

#
# build, or run, in unpredictable ways.
